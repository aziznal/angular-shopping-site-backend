# Angular-Based Shopping Site - Backend
This is the backend for the [Frontend Repository](https://www.github.com/aziznal/angular-shopping-site-frontend)

It's built with NodeJS and ExpressJS. MongoDB is required for full functionality. Better support will be added in the future.

---
Note: No data is currently available in the site, which means it works but there's no items to browse / buy.
An intializer script will be added soon to load a JSON file that contains all items into a mongoDB-based database.
